## Introduction
In this project, we use the Life_Expectancy_Data.csv dataset to predict life expectancy using various features such as adult mortality, alcohol consumption, GDP, and more. The model is built using the Scikit-Learn and XGBoost libraries.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is Life_Expectancy_Data.csv. It contains various features related to health, economic, and social factors that influence life expectancy.

##Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn
xgboost
You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost

## Exploratory Data Analysis
We start by loading the dataset and performing basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data. This includes:

Displaying basic information and statistics about the dataset.
Visualizing missing values using a heatmap.
Plotting histograms for each feature.
Creating a correlation matrix to understand relationships between features.
## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:

Handling missing values by filling them with the mean of the respective columns.
Converting categorical variables into dummy/indicator variables using pd.get_dummies.
Splitting the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y).
## Model Training
We use the XGBoost regressor to train our model. The steps include:

Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Initializing the XGBoost regressor with specific parameters.
Training the model on the training data.
## Evaluation
The model is evaluated using the test data. We calculate the following metrics:

R-squared (R²) score
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a machine learning regression model to predict life expectancy. The model can be further improved by tuning hyperparameters, adding more features, or using different algorithms.
